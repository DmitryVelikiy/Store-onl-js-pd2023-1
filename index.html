                    <h3>Brand History</h3>
                    <p>The company was founded in Detroit in 1903 by Henry Ford, who created it after receiving $28,000 from five investors to develop the business. <br> Immediately after the company's creation, car inventor George Selden sued it, claiming Ford was infringing his patent; in 1911 a court invalidated Selden's patent. <br> Ford's first automobile was the Model A, with 1,708 produced in its first year. In August 1904 a plant was opened in Canada, and in 1908 the first overseas sales office was opened in Paris. <br> The first mass-produced model produced by the company was the Ford Model T, produced between 1908 and 1927; 10,000 were produced in 1909 alone, and 15 million in all years. <br> Ford gained fame as the first in the world to use the classic car assembly line, first launched in 1913. The use of the assembly line reduced the price of the Ford Model T from $950 in 1909 to $290 in 1926.
                    <br>Ford Motor was ranked 22nd among the largest U.S. companies by revenue in 2022 (Fortune 500 list) <br> and 53rd among the largest companies in the world (Fortune Global 500 list). Ford Motor was ranked 60th on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest public companies for 2022.</p>

                    <h3>Brand History</h3>
                    <p>In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the automatic Toyoda Model G loom. The principle of zidoka, meaning that the machine stops by itself <br> when a problem occurs, later became part of Toyota's production system. The looms were assembled on a small production line. In 1929, <br>     the patent for the automatic loom was sold to a British company, the proceeds of which provided the seed money for the development of automobile production.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Toyota Motor was the world's largest automaker from 2007-2009 and has held that title since 2012.
                    In the first quarter of 2007 Toyota produced and sold more cars than <br> General Motors (GM) for the first time. GM held the title of "the world's largest automaker" for 76 years. But in recent years, GM, like other U.S. automakers, <br> was in crisis and had to cut production - the free space on the market is occupied by competitors, primarily Toyota. On April 24, the Japanese company said it produced <br> 2.37 million cars in the first quarter and sold 2.35 million. Thus, for the first time it surpassed GM with 2,34 mln and 2,26 mln cars.</p>
